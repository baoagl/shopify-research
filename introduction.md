### What is Shopify?
Shopify is a fully-hosted, cloud-based E-commerce platform suitable for all sizes of businesses.

Basically, Shopify provides users an online solution, which allows them to quickly build their own website to sell products without coding. It might take time for small business owners to hire graphic designers or to get used to design software, but this one-of-a-kind online selling platform has you covered. 

There is no requirement for software installation or a hosting service; Shopify has everything that is essential to the success of any online store.

### How does it work?
Here's an overview of how Shopify works:
- **Build your store**. Shopify has more than 70 store themes to choose from, and there are drag-and-drop capabilities to make things easier. You customize the colors, images and fonts. The site you build also automatically works on mobile. You can list an unlimited number of products.

- **Track your business**. Shopify has a dashboard that displays reports, analytics and other information on desktop and mobile. You can manage things from the Shopify Mobile app as well, including uploading product photos, setting pricing, dealing with refunds, seeing sales and visitor traffic, getting order notifications and communicating with your staff.

### Shopify partner program
The partner program is an “ecosystem”, usually made up of freelancers, created to help boost their businesses and generate ongoing monthly revenue through commissions.
